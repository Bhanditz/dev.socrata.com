For Socrata customers, FME is a fantastic tool for helping to address many data ingress issues. FME allows users to access, transform, and then automatically load their spatial and non-spatial based data into Socrata. With FME, Socrata customers are able to increase the amount of data available to the public by reducing the burden and difficulties of data integration.

Safe Software has partnered with Socrata to build an FME "writer" for Socrata. Using the Socrata Writer, you can easily create workflows to extract data from source systems using Safe FME, perform cleanup and transformation, and publish that data to Socrata. In this video, Adrian Laurenzi, from the Socrata Customer Success Team, provides an overview and demo of how this work using FME and then loading data into Socrata using the FME "writer" for Socrata.
