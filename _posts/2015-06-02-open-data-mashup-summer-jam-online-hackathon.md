Socrata is excited to partner with [ChallengePost](http://challengepost.com/) and [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) on this year's [Summer Jam hackathon series](http://summerjam.challengepost.com/). The series is comprised of eight online hackathons open to participants around the world. Each one is three weeks long, and the event runs through August 3rd, so it's the perfect way to keep sharp over your summer vacation, learn some new skills, and try out some new APIs.

Our category is [Open Data Mashup](http://sjopendata.challengepost.com/), and it's open to any visualization, story, or experience that makes use of at least two open datasets. We've lined up an awesome panel of judges including:

- Tom Schenk Jr., Chief Data Office for the [City of Chicago](http://data.cityofchicago.org)
- Neil Phantom, Manager of the [World Bank Open Data Initiative](http://data.worldbank.org/)
- Noel Hidalgo, Executive Director of [BetaNYC](http://betanyc.us/)
- Shaida Badiee, Managing Director of [Open Data Watch](http://www.opendatawatch.com/)
- Myself, Chris Metcalf, Director of Developer Experience for [Socrata](http://socrata.com)

Best of all, if you win, you'll receive not only a brand new [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/watch/), but also personal mentoring from the Socrata developer evangelism team on how to build out, market, and sell your app in the [Socrata Apps Marketplace](http://open-data-apps.socrata.com/).

Need open data for your visualizations? Check out the [Open Data Network](http://www.opendatanetwork.com/), our new open data search engine, which searches our network of hundreds of open data websites across the country and around the world. There's also an open API available via [Socrata Labs](http://labs.socrata.com/docs/search.html)!

The [Open Data Mashup](http://sjopendata.challengepost.com/) category runs now through June 22nd, so [sign up now](http://sjopendata.challengepost.com/) and get hacking! This weekend's [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://socrata.com/developer-blog-article/developer-support-for-national-day-of-civic-hacking-2015/) would be a great opportunity to get a jump-start on your projects.

Good luck, and may the best visualization win!
