[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/socrata/dev.socrata.com.svg?branch=surge)](https://travis-ci.org/socrata/dev.socrata.com)

This is the [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) source code for the [Socrata Developer Portal](http://dev.socrata.com) (currently deployed to <http://dev.socrata.com>.

## Contributing

We love pull requests! If you'd like to contribute, feel free to [fork this repo](https://github.com/socrata/dev.socrata.com/fork) and send us pull requests.

### Setting Up

The site is a customized [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site, so there are some steps you'll need to take care of to get your environment set up:

1. Make sure you have the `gh-pages` branch checked out: `git checkout -b gh-pages origin/gh-pages`
2. Pull in the site templates and CSS/SASS, which come from submodules: `git submodule update --init`
3. Make sure you have Ruby version installed. Check `.ruby-version` to see the preferred version. If you're using rbenv or rvm, this should automatically be set up
4. Install the Bundler Gem installed: `gem install bundler`
5. Set up the Gem bundle: `bundle`
6. Make sure you have the `jekyll` RubyGem installed
7. You can then run one of several options on the `Rakefile`, depending on your setup:
    - `rake incremental` will perform a Jekyll build into `./public`. If rerun, it'll be faster since it'll only build what you have changed.
    - `rake watch` will perform an incremental build automatically when you change files, which is handy if you're using something like [Pow](https://pow.cx)
    - `rake serve` will run a standalone server for testing

### Submitting a Blog Post

We love submissions from the community! If you'd like to submit a [blog post](https://dev.socrata.com/blog/) about something you've built with the Socrata APIs, about open data technology, or something we might just be interested in, craft your blog post as a [pull request](https://github.com/socrata/dev.socrata.com/pulls) and submit it for review:

1. Review [other posts](https://dev.socrata.com/blog/) and [submissions](https://github.com/socrata/dev.socrata.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Ablog+is%3Aclosed) to get a feel for the tone and language, and to see how others have formatted their posts.
2. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/socrata/dev.socrata.com) into your account
3. Create a new blog post, either by
  - Running `rake post` and following the prompts
  - Copying another post from [`_posts`](https://github.com/socrata/dev.socrata.com/tree/gh-pages/_post) and creating a new file of the format `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`
4. Write your post in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), following a few rules:
  - Set the `author` key in the [YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) to your GitHub username so you get proper author credit
  - If your post uses any images, add them to the [`img`](https://github.com/socrata/dev.socrata.com/tree/gh-pages/img) folder, prepended with your post date
  - Proof your post either using the instructions above to build and view the site, or using a Markdown preview tool like [Marked](http://marked2app.com/) or the one provided by GitHub.
5. Submit your post and any required files as a pull request against the `gh-pages` branch.

We'll review your post for content and acceptability. If there are any problems, we'll either fix them or let you know why we can't accept your post.

Please note that by submitting a post to the Socrata Developer Blog, you are are granting us an irrevocable license to distribute your work on dev.socrata.com or other mediums we choose. It will be covered by the same Creative Commons license as the rest of the content of dev.socrata.com.

### Before Submitting

Before submitting, run `rake test` and `rake htmlproof` to run the test suite and confirm that you haven't broken anything.

### Modifying CSS/SASS

Site styling is controlled via `css/local.sass` and it's automatically regenerated by Github Pages with each push.
